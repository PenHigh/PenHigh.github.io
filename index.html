                <p>
                    The PHS Coding Club is a club that teaches students how to code and develop their own projects. We
                    develop projects using a variety of programming languages and frameworks. We also help students
                    learn how to use technology to solve problems. We meet every Tuesday and Thursday during lunch in
                    room 133.
                </p>
